# ❤️ Heart Attack Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the presence of heart disease based on various medical attributes. It's built with Python, pandas, and scikit-learn, and features a user-friendly interface for inputting patient data and getting quick predictions.


## 📊 Data Source

The dataset used in this project is from the **Kaggle**:

- 📁 **File:** heart (1).csv


## 🚀 Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and transformation
- Machine learning model training (classification)
- UI for user inputs and prediction results  

## 🖥️ User Interface (UI)

The UI allows users to enter patient health data and receive a heart disease prediction.

### ✅ Input Fields:

- Age
- Gender
